Teachers are presented with a list of all of their students and for each student they must select the status of either 'present', 'basent', or 'counted'. Teachers can also leave additional notes to the admin if they wish. This information is then used by the admin to know how much each teacher is owed at payday. Teachers are also able to view any documents they might have under their profile, such as their tax forms. The app uses email and password authentication powered by Next Auth.",

The booking logic was one of the more complicated features of this project, as it had to take into account the availability of each therapist as well as which therapist can perform which service. After choosing the details of their appointment, visitors can then proceed to Stripe checkout to make a payment. After a successful payment, a Stripe webhook is fired to a Route Handler and the user's appointment details are added to MongoDB database, at which point the user gets an automatic email (via Nodemailer) confirming the details of their appointment.",
